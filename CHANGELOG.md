## v0.1.1
- Homebrew formula: unpin Python to `python` (no `python@3.11`).
- Enforce per-repo mapping for `sync`; require `skuld add` before running.
- Remove cross-project auto-detection; `sync` will not pull time from other WakaTime projects.
- Update tap test to `--help` for stable CI.

## v0.1.0
- Initial public CLI and Homebrew formula.
